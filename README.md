# Maps on a Stick

Maps on a Stick is a lightweight mapping solution for mobile, unplugged maps.

It includes a launcher, called `runner.py`, that wraps functionality for 
usage via a GUI.

MapBox tilesets - rendered map tiles stored in structured SQLite databases - 
are supported, as well as KML input.

File-based tilesets, as used in the previous version of Maps on a Stick, are 
not supported.

# Using Maps on a Stick
